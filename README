DropMail
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DropMail is a small program which runs intermittently, reads a directory for
files, reads them and tries to send each one as an email using the contents
supplied inside the file.

The main reason for using this program is so that you programs or websites can
still send email, but they don't have to try and use any of the mail clients or
libraries around to do the cause, they just write a small datastructure out to
a file in JSON format and this program does the rest.

They also don't have to wait around for the MTA to accept each and every mail,
and instead can concentrate on serving the request as soon as possible so it
can return to the user for a speedy looking website.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example (Perl)

For example, in a Perl program, instead of using Email::Send, Mail::SendMail,
Mail::SendEasy, Mail::Sender or even MIME::Lite, you just use JSON::Any and
write a data structure to a file.

Synopsis:

    use JSON::Any;
    use File::Slurp;

    my $email = {
        to    => 'someone@example.com',
        from  => 'someone@example.org',
        # cc  => # scalar or array
        # bcc => # scalar or array
        copy_self => 1, # default 0, copy 'from' address to the 'bcc' list
        subject => 'Hello, World!',
        text => 'This is the content', # required
        html => '<p>This is the content</p>', # optional
        # attachments => [ ... ] # coming soon
    };

    write_file( q{/var/lib/dropmail/myprog/0001.json}, JSON::Any->objToJson($email) );

That's all there is to it. At some point later, DropMail will try and send that
email. If it can't send it, it will email the address given in /etc/dropmail.rc.
